**OpenAI Model Craft Challenge: Parameter Golf** is a challenge to train the best language model that fits in a 16MB artifact and trains in under 10 minutes on 8xH100s, evaluated by compression on the FineWeb validation set (tokenizer-agnostic, bits per byte).

This challenge is heavily inspired by the [NanoGPT Speedrunning](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt) challenge, where participants compete to train a model that reaches 3.28 FineWeb validation loss as quickly as possible. We're excited to see how optimizing for a parameter-constrained setting pushes people toward unique architectures (test-time compute, aggressive parameter tying, depth recurrence, low-rank training, ...), compression schemes (low precision, QAT, bitnets, novel tokenizers, ...), and other creative submissions (test-time training, long context, megakernels ...). 

If you're familiar with [neural scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), you can consider this challenge a form of L(N) optimization, where the objective is to optimize the lowest loss given a fixed number of parameters (N) unconstrained by data, compute, steps, or architecture. Challenges like the [NanoGPT Speedrun](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt), which optimizes for a form of L(T) (~lowest time given constrained loss) or the [NanoGPT Slowrun](https://github.com/qlabs-eng/slowrun), which optimizes for L(D) (lowest loss given constrained dataset size), can be thought of as equivalent challenges in this family.

Ideally, we'd allow for submissions to use arbitrary computational resources. But in order to make the challenge not inaccessibly expensive, we're limiting *leaderboard submissions* to 10 minutes on 8xH100s. However, we'd still love to see submissions that don't meet the compute limitation requirements in our 'Non-record Submissions' section: We're excited to see people push the infinite frontier of parameter limited performance as well.

We also know compute is expensive, so **OpenAI is sponsoring $1,000,000 in compute credits** to help people get started training their models. To request a compute grant, use this form: [Request a Compute Grant](https://openai.com/index/parameter-golf/#credit-form).
When requesting compute, please make sure you choose the appropriate level, write sufficient justification, and **submit with an email tied to a OpenAI / ChatGPT account**.

## Participant Form

If you enjoy solving very difficult technical problems, please introduce yourself via the [Challenge Participant Form](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openai/form/open-ai-challenge-parameter-golf). It helps us attribute challenge submissions and reach out about opportunities with OpenAI. _Completing the form is not required to participate._

Many researchers at OpenAI first distinguished themselves through elite mathematics and programming competitions. The Model Craft Challenge is designed in that spirit: testing the ability to tackle unfamiliar problems with creativity and rigor, qualities we believe are essential for frontier AI research.

In June, we plan to hire a small cohort of early-career researchers, targeting current undergraduate students and recent graduates, including Olympiad medalists and elite competitors. For exceptional participants, the challenge may also serve as a way to stand out to OpenAI researchers and recruiters.

The challenge runs from March 18th to April 30th. 

Happy training!

#### Leaderboard Comparison

The leaderboard has improved by **0.1434 bpb** from the naive baseline to the current best record. The largest gains have come from a few repeatable themes:

| Stage | Representative Run | Score | Gain vs. Previous Stage | What Changed |
|-------|--------------------|------:|-------------------------:|--------------|
| Baseline | Naive Baseline | 1.2244 | - | 9-layer tied-embedding GPT with the starter tokenizer and training recipe |
| Longer context and tuned training | 4k seq length | 1.2014 | 0.0230 | Higher sequence length, better hyperparameters, and stronger evaluation setup |
| Quantization and wider MLPs | 11L MLP3x + Int6 QAT | 1.1502 | 0.0512 | Larger effective model under the 16MB cap through aggressive quantization |
| Test-time and optimizer advances | LeakyReLU² + Legal Score-First TTT + Parallel Muon | 1.1194 | 0.0308 | Legal TTT, activation changes, and stronger optimizer behavior |
| Recurrence and residual topology | Parallel Residuals + Mini Depth Recurrence | 1.1063 | 0.0131 | Reused depth, parallel residual lanes, and GPTQ calibration improvements |
| SP8192 frontier | SP8192 + 3-Layer Recurrence + Parallel Residuals + Legal TTT | 1.0810 | 0.0253 | Larger tokenizer, recurrence, parallel residuals, GPTQ embeddings, QK gain, and legal score-first TTT |

Use this as a map, not a recipe. Strong submissions usually combine one architectural idea, one compression idea, and one measurement discipline improvement rather than only tuning a single knob.

#### Unlimited Compute Leaderboard & Non-record Submissions

| 4-Hour Baseline | 1.2074 | Will DePue | Testing unlimited compute, 4 hours on 8xH100 | 2026-03-18 | [info](records/track_non_record_16mb/2026-03-18_Quasi10Bfrom50B_SP1024_9x512_KV4_4h_pgut3/README.md) |

#### Innovation Phase

Breakthrough ideas are rarely immediately state-of-the-art, instead, they're developed slowly, first demonstrating signs-of-life, iterated on, then only ultimately optimized on the systems side. Don't get discouraged if a new algorithm doesn't instantly beat the best leaderboard run or even the naive baseline. If you have an idea you believe in, consider ignoring step times early on: once you prove you can beat the baseline in the same # of steps you can then start focusing on how to also make it fast.

We'd love to see weird & creative ideas in the challenge, since you never know what may work in the end. Most likely, these will be a good fit in our unlimited compute leaderboard as non-record submissions. We have some requests for what we'd love to see people implement:

Good innovation-phase PRs should answer three questions:

1. **Signal:** What improves, even if the run is not leaderboard-ready yet?
2. **Cost:** What does the idea spend: parameters, code bytes, wallclock, evaluation time, or implementation complexity?
3. **Path:** What is the next bottleneck between the signs-of-life result and a competitive record?

## Getting Started

### Training Your First Model (Mac with Apple Silicon)

If you have an Apple laptop or desktop with Apple Silicon, we've set up a simple MLX training script to help you start iterating locally.

If you don't have a Mac with Apple Silicon, you can run an adapted version of this script without MLX support. Just ask [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) to refactor it; the change is straightforward. It may still be fairly slow, so we recommend jumping straight to cloud GPUs with Runpod.

First, clone the repository, create a fresh Python environment, and install the packages needed for the MLX path plus dataset download:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/parameter-golf.git
cd parameter-golf
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mlx numpy sentencepiece huggingface-hub datasets tqdm
```

Download our cached version of FineWeb with the 1024-token vocabulary:

```bash
python3 data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py --variant sp1024 --train-shards 10
```

This populates `./data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp1024/` and `./data/tokenizers/`.
By default this downloads the full validation split plus 80 training shards (8B tokens). For a smaller local smoke subset, pass `--train-shards 1`, for example `python3 data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py --variant sp1024 --train-shards 1`.

Then run a small MLX training job:

```bash
RUN_ID=mlx_smoke \
ITERATIONS=200 \
TRAIN_BATCH_TOKENS=8192 \
VAL_LOSS_EVERY=0 \
VAL_BATCH_SIZE=8192 \
python3 train_gpt_mlx.py
```

Validation always runs on the full `fineweb_val_*` split, which is the fixed first-50k-document set. The smoke command above skips periodic validation and just prints the final `val_loss` and `val_bpb` once at the end.

### Scaling Up to a Remote Machine

Once you're happy with your local tests, or you want more compute, switch to a remote CUDA machine.

You can rent GPUs from anywhere, but OpenAI is partnering with Runpod to make setup as easy as possible.  

#### Launching a 1xH100 Pod

1. First, [create a Runpod account](https://console.runpod.io/deploy). You should also set up an SSH key in the Settings tab on the left so you can connect to your remote machine. If you're new to this, ask Codex to help you set it up.

2. Once you've set up your account, create a new GPU Cloud Pod. You can choose whichever GPU SKU you'd like. Final leaderboard submissions must run in under 10 minutes on 8xH100s (specifically the SXM variant), but we strongly recommend testing and running experiments on cheaper SKUs first, since an 8xH100 box can cost around $20/hour.

3. Let's start with a 1xH100 pod. Deploy using the official Parameter Golf template: [Launch Template](https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=y5cejece4j&ref=nl2r56th). Enable SSH terminal access, leaving the other settings at their defaults. Deploy your pod and SSH into it once it's up. You should land in `/workspace/`.

On your remote machine, clone the repo onto local disk. All Python dependencies are already pre-installed in the image.

```bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/openai/parameter-golf.git
cd parameter-golf
```

Download our cached version of FineWeb. We'll use the 1024-token vocabulary for now.

```bash
python3 data/cached_challenge_fineweb.py --variant sp1024
```

This defaults to the full validation split plus 80 training shards (8B tokens). If you only want a smaller subset while iterating, pass `--train-shards N`, for example `--train-shards 1`.

Launch your first training run. Note that we're passing `nproc_per_node=1` because we're running on a single H100 GPU in this case.

```bash
RUN_ID=baseline_sp1024 \
DATA_PATH=./data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp1024/ \
TOKENIZER_PATH=./data/tokenizers/fineweb_1024_bpe.model \
VOCAB_SIZE=1024 \
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=1 train_gpt.py
```

By default, `train_gpt.py` keeps its ~10 minute wallclock cap. If you want a longer run, override it explicitly, for example `MAX_WALLCLOCK_SECONDS=0`.

By default, this command prints `train_loss` step logs during training and prints `val_loss`, `val_bpb`, and compressed model size in the final `final_int8_zlib_roundtrip` lines at the end. If you want periodic validation logs during the run, set `VAL_LOSS_EVERY`, for example `VAL_LOSS_EVERY=200`. For the baseline config, the final `val_bpb` should land around ~1.2 with a compressed model size under 16MB.

For dataset export, tokenizer export, and docs-cache rebuild instructions, see [data/README.md](data/README.md).

Evaluation will be in the RunPod environment with all packages installed. `requirements.txt` is provided as a reference if you want to self-setup.

## FAQ

**What exactly counts toward the 16MB artifact size?**

The submission artifact is computed as code bytes plus compressed model bytes. All counted code should live in the `train_gpt.py` script.
The cap is decimal 16MB, i.e. 16,000,000 total bytes, not 16 MiB / 16,777,216 bytes.
No external downloads, training dataset access, or network calls are allowed during evaluation. The artifact must be fully self-contained and reproducible.

**Are scores independently verified by OpenAI?**

We're not automatically verifying every submission, but we will verify the top leaderboard entries over time. Any non-reproducible results can be disqualified, and issues reproducing submissions should be raised on the PR. If you find an issue with a record on the leaderboard or find a record isn't reproducible, please let us know and add an Github Issue describing your findings.

**What counts as 'external compute'? For example, is it fair to tune my hyperparameters offline?**

There's no perfectly clear answer here and it's hard to draw a clean line around what does or does not count as external compute. For now, we're reserving the right to disqualify runs that are not in the spirit of the challenge. Tuning your Adam hyperparameters across a bunch of runs is fine, but if there's evidence that you're sneaking in additional compute unfairly, such as brute-forcing ridiculous seeds, we won't allow it. Use your best judgment and there's no penalty for asking questions.

**What are the restrictions on evaluation?**

We won't accept submissions that take more than 10 minutes on 8xH100 to evaluate (Note: This limit is in addition to the 10 minutes of training time allowed!), but otherwise you're free to evaluate however. As with modded-nanogpt, we allow evaluation at any sequence length. And, obviously, you aren't allowed to access any training data during evaluation, unless you pay for those bits in the <16MB limit. We encourage competitors to push the bounds of evaluation methods as aggressively as with training methods. You CANNOT access validation data during training, e.g. by compressing it into your 16mb with "paid prefix".

If it isn't abundantly obvious: You can't cheat on your test loss. You can't cheat by training on the validation set before you evaluate on the validation set. The validation language around test-time training has been confusing people: you are only allowed to test-time train on validation set tokens _you've already evaluated your model on_, since those tokens have already been graded!

**What is the process for accepting new submissions?**

Since all submissions are public, we're accepting record submissions chronologically depending on their PR creation time. The leaderboard may take time to update due to verification and review of submissions, so pay consideration to what the current SOTA PR is when submitting. As explained below, submissions should exceed the SOTA record with sufficient statistical significance in order to be accepted for the leaderboard. Otherwise, submissions may be accepted as 'non-record submissions' given they are sufficiently unique or interesting.

**Can I import XYZ package or library?**

Yes, you're free to import any package or library you want, so long as it does not unjustly violate the rules on evaluation, compute, training time, code size or otherwise. Just include a requirements.txt in your records folder and mention setup instructions in your README.md. Since you don't pay for bits imported in Python libraries, limitations clearly apply: You can't sneak in extra compute, capabilities, or massively increase effective code size with custom libraries, but importing FlashAttention, etc. is completely fine.


## Submission Process

New SOTA records must fulfill the following criteria:

1. They must beat the existing SOTA by at least 0.005 nats. As in modded-nanogpt, because of inter-run variance all submissions must provide enough run logs to show at `p < 0.01` that they achieved the required 0.005-nat improvement. For submissions that improve speed through systems optimization without changing the ML, this requirement is waived.

2. If changes are made to the tokenizer or dataset, prove with certainty that the val_bpb is correctly calculated. Submissions that edit the tokenizer will be examined much more carefully, since bugs may unjustly improve your score.

3. Reproducibly run in under 10 minutes on 8xH100s.

All submissions should be made as a pull request that only adds a new folder to the appropriate `/records` subfolder and includes the following files. Submissions without the full set of requirements will not be accepted.

1. A README.md file that explains the submission in reasonable detail.

2. A `submission.json` file (see the example runs) that includes your name, GitHub ID, `val_bpb`, and related metadata.

3. A train log, automatically produced by your script. Please demonstrate a statistically significant win. Most often, submitting an average over 3 training runs is sufficient.

4. A `train_gpt.py` script and any other dependencies. Note: this must successfully compile and run within the records folder. Broken scripts will not be accepted.

### Non-record Submissions

Submissions are also open to unique and interesting approaches that might not beat the existing SOTA, but still satisfy the 16MB artifact limit. We strongly encourage participants to submit implementations for weird or out-of-the-box ideas, in-progress or unoptimized solutions, so long as they run successfully, or even interesting negative results. We're excited to see what you come up with. We'll still maintain a high bar for non-record submissions, so be sure to justify your ideas and results in detail when submitting.

We also accept non-record submissions to an unlimited compute track for runs that are not intended to meet the 10-minute cutoff. Just note as such in your README file.

Non-record submissions should be made in the same fashion as SOTA records, as described above.

#### PRs on Core Code

The `train_gpt.py` and `train_gpt_mlx.py` scripts are intended as good launching-off points for new participants, not SOTA configs. We'll accept PRs that tune, improve, or simplify these scripts without significantly increasing complexity, but the best models should stay in the `/records` folder.
